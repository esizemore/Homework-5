1. Use this data file, which gives the temperature in Munich every day for several years. Read in the data, and mask the bad values, then try and fit the following function to the data: 
              f(t)=acos(2pi*t+b)+c
 Where t is the time in years. Make a plot of the data and the best-fit model in the range 2008 to 2012. 
 a) What are the best-fit values of the parameters? Generate Plot. 
 b)What is the overall average temperature in Munich, and what are the typical daily average values predicted by the model for the coldest and hottest time of year?
 c)What is the meaning of the b parameter, and does its value make sense?
 
 
 2. SDSS Data Fitting:
 Download the data from the SDSS DR!# (ww.sdss.org/dr13) APOGEE Survey main summary file (allStar-l30e.2.fits)
 You will be looking at fitting the chemical trends. 
 Make the following selection of the data: 59<GLAT<61
 Fit FE_H vs. O_FE. Fit two different functions:1)linear 2)quadratic
 
 a)What are the best fit values of the parameters? Generate Plot.
 b)Which function fits the data best?
 c)Is there a second population?(Can you fit the outliers with a reasonable linear trend?)
